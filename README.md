# RESTAURANT-OPERATION-ANALYSIS
## OVERVIEW
This project uses SQL to analyze a restaurant's sales, customer behaviour, and operational efficiency. The dataset contains information on orders, menu items, transactions, and employee performance. The goal is to uncover key insights that can help optimize menu offerings, improve customer experience, and enhance staff performance.
Using SQL, I performed data cleaning, aggregation, and advanced querying techniques to extract meaningful insights. The analysis covers best-selling items, peak sales periods, customer spending patterns, and employee productivity.

**Objectives**
The primary objectives of this project were to:
- Design a scalable and well-normalized restaurant database using SQL.

**Recommended Analysis**
1. What were the least and most ordered items? What categories were they in?

What do the highest spend orders look like? Which items did they buy and how much did they spend?

Were there certain times that had more or fewer orders?

Based on the data, which cuisines should we focus on developing more menu items for?
