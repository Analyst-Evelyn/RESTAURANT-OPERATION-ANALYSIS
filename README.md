# RESTAURANT-OPERATION-ANALYSIS
## OVERVIEW 
This project uses SQL to analyze a restaurant's sales, customer behaviour, and operational efficiency. The dataset contains information on orders, menu items, transactions, and employee performance. The goal is to uncover key insights that can help optimize menu offerings, improve customer experience, and enhance staff performance.
Using SQL, I performed data cleaning, aggregation, and advanced querying techniques to extract meaningful insights. The analysis covers best-selling items, peak sales periods, customer spending patterns, and employee productivity. Power Bi was used for the data visualization.

## Key Recommendations for Business Growth  

1. Improve Sales During Low-Peak Hours (10:00 AM - 10:59 AM)
   
    Offer breakfast specials, combo deals, or discounts during this period to increase.
   
2. Optimize High-Peak Hour Performance (12:00 PM - 12:59 PM)
   
     Increase staffing and ensure fast service during this rush period.
   
     Implement pre-prepared meals for fast-moving items (Hamburgers, Edamame).
    
 5. Adjust Pricing for Low and High-Performing Menu Items.
    
    Increase the price of Edamame from $5.00 to $6.50 (20% markup)
    Reduce the price of Chicken Tacos( a discount on Chicken Tacos or bundle it with a drink to improve sales).
    
7. Promote High-Margin Items like Shrimp Scampi ($19.90).
   
   Feature Shrimp Scampi as a premium meal on the menu.
   
9. Menu Optimization – Focus on Best Sellers & Remove Underperformers.
