# RESTAURANT-OPERATION-ANALYSIS
#OVERVIEW
This project analyzes a restaurant's sales, customer behavior, and operational efficiency using SQL. The dataset contains information on orders, menu items, transactions, and employee performance. The goal is to uncover key insights that can help optimize menu offerings, improve customer experience, and enhance staff performance.

Using SQL, I performed data cleaning, aggregation, and advanced querying techniques to extract meaningful insights. The analysis covers best-selling items, peak sales periods, customer spending patterns, and employee productivity.

This data was gotten from  Maven Analytics Playground
